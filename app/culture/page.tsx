            and the world around us. It acknowledges that our culture is
            dynamic, adapting alongside us. It took us about a year and a half
            to live through the wins and challenges, find opportunities to learn
            from them, and finally structure them into this document that
            captures the essence of what it means to be part of 'Creator

            We take responsibility for our actions and their outcomes. Each team
            member is empowered to take initiative and make decisions, owning
            both successes and mistakes. Accountability fosters trust, and trust
            is the bedrock of our collaborative efforts.

              Provide/Seek Clear Instructions: When assigning or taking on a

              push for comprehensive information from clients/teammates.
              Feedback from a client/teammate might differ from what we presume.
              Seeking context in those times helps us align better and get

              Document Processes: Maintain clear documentation of workflows and
